     <!-- <h2>Britney Spears Lyrics </h2>
     <p>I was Born to love you</p>
      <p>Oh, my love <br>
        Oh, yeah yeah <br>
        Oh, yeah</p>

     <p>I’m sitting here alone up in my room <br>
        I’m thinking ’bout the times that we’ve been through <br>
        Oh, my love <br>
        I’m looking at a picture in my hand <br>
        Trying my best to understand <br>
        I really wanna know what we did wrong <br>
        With a love that felt so strong <br>
        <br><br>
        If only you were here tonight <br>
        I know that we could make it right <br>
        I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
        I was born to make you happy <br>
        ‘Cause you’re the only one up in my heart <br>
        I was born to make you happy <br>
        Always and forever, you and me <br>
        That’s the way our life should be <br>
        I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
        I was born to make you happy <br>



        I know I’ve been a fool since you’ve been gone <br>
I’d better give it up and carry on <br>
Oh, my love <br>
‘Cause living in a dream of you and me <br>
Is not the way my life should be <br>
I don’t wanna cry a tear for you <br>
So forgive me if I do (ooh) <br>

If only you were here tonight <hr>
I know that we could make it right <br>

I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
I was born to make you happy <br>
‘Cause you’re the only one up in my heart <br>
I was born to make you happy <br>
Always and forever, you and me <br>
That’s the way our life should be <br>
I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
I was born to make you happy <br>

(Oh yeah) 
(Oh yeah) <br>
I’d do anything <br>
I’d give you my world <br>
I’d wait forever to be your girl <br>
(Just call out my name) <br>
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (ooh) <br>
Just to show you how much I care <br>
(Alright) (ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (ooh) (oh yeah) <br>

I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
I was born to make you happy <br> 
‘Cause you’re the only one up in my heart <br>
I was born to make you happy <br>
Always and forever, you and me <br>
That’s the way our life should be <br>
I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
I was born to make you happy <br>

(Oh, oh)
I was born to make you happy <br>
(Oh yeah, oh oh yeah) <br>

Always and forever, you and me <br>
That’s the way our life should be <br>
I don’t know how to live without your love <br>
I was born to make you happy <br>
